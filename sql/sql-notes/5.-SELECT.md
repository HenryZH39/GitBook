# 5. SELECT
- Uniqueness: DISTINCT

- Pagination: LIMIT & OFFSET
	**limiting the number of items displayed** and **skipping the first specified number of items**.
	```SQL
	SELECT * FROM `new_schema`.`users` LIMIT 3 OFFSET 1;
	```

- Sorting: ORDER
	```SQL
	SELECT * FROM `new_schema`.`users` ORDER BY age ASC,
	SELECT * FROM `new_schema`.`users` ORDER BY age DESC,
	SELECT * FROM `new_schema`.`users` ORDER BY age DESC, height DESC;
	```

- Grouping : GROUP BY
	```SQL
	SELECT `age` FROM `new_schema`.`users` GROUP BY age;
	SELECT COUNT(*), `age` FROM `new_schema`.`users` GROUP BY age;
	```
	optimized
	```SQL
	SELECT COUNT(*) AS `age_count`, `age`
	FROM `new_schema`.`users`
	GROUP BY age
	ORDER BY `age_count`; (ASC|DESC;)
	```
