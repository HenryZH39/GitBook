### STAR technique in BQ
  - Situation:
    - Story and share the context or challenge you faced
  - Task:
    - Describe your responsibility or role in the situation or challenge. In other words, discuss the goal or task set out for you. 
  - Action:
    - Explain the specific actions you took to handle the situation or overcome the challenge. This part of your answer requires the most in-depth description as this is what largely indicates your fitness for a role. Identify and discuss a few of the most impactful steps you took to find success.
  - Result:
    - What was the outcome you reached through your actions. Quantify your success or provide concrete examples of the effects of your efforts if possible
  - Learning:
    - What you learn after
